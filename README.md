# NorthStarContributions
Anything we make for Project North Star goes here

Note: One or more mechanical parts are modified from the original [Project North Star](https://github.com/leapmotion/ProjectNorthStar) repository. As such, this entire repository is licensed under GPL version 3, and we're saying up front where we sourced that content from. Everything here is made for, and intended to be used with, Project North Star.

## DAS Mod
The HTC vive Deluxe Audio Strap is one of the best off-the-shelf solutions available for head-mounted-display headgear. Some consider it superior to the default option that ships with Project North Star. The DAS mod is currently known to be compatible with North Star version 3.1. It is un-known what changes will need to be made for 3.2 compatibility. We believe that only DAS NS Lid.stl will need to change.
